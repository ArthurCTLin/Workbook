## Introduction to Numerical Analysis
* **Professor :** Kai-Feng, Chen (NTU)
* **Course website :** https://hep1.phys.ntu.edu.tw/~kfjack/lecture/numerical/2020/

The contents of Lecture 1 to 2 are the introduction to the basic tool, such as python, linear algebra, Random numbersâ€¦etc, and I just skipped these parts and focused on the Lecture 3 (machine learning).

The details of the assignments and their corresponding results can be check in my personal website : [**Introduction to Numerical Analysis (Assignment)**](https://hackmd.io/uwn4aO1VTa6XYs6nD3GdHQ?both#Introduction-to-Numerical-Analysis-Assignment).
